# And now a little bit about me...\!

I am a first year PhD student at UBC's [Institute for Resources, Environment and Sustainability](http://ires.ubc.ca). I have a background in engineering. I would tell you about my thesis topic if I could figure it out for myself...! :confused:

I've lived in Vancouver for four years.
